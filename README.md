A set of scripts for PROXMOX


[cleanup.sh](https://github.com/peterwup/myproxmox/blob/main/cleanup.sh)
* script to clean up proxmox things like logged data or old kernel files ....
* I found it somwhere on github
* I just use it in simulation mode and check what it would do and do it partly by hand

[getscript.sh](https://github.com/peterwup/myproxmox/blob/main/getscripts.sh)
* script to download all the scripts from github to proxmox
* push them at the right position
* set the "executable" flags to them for all users
